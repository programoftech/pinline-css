**Programming** is **complex/strange** and not everyone can understand it. So, in order to make sure that *beginners don't give up in the beginning*, we are introducing certain **tools** that will help in *smoothening the learning curve while shifting from HTML to CSS*.

Throught **PInline CSS**, you can *write CSS within HTML Attributes* without looking for an entirely new syntax.

PInline CSS also takes care of browser compatibility which means that you pinline code will work in every browser.

<br>

> Note: The attributes used to write CSS don't mess up with the built in attributes as they all start with a prefix "p-"

	And many more...

```
